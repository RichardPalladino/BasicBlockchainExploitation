# ConsoleCowboy's Basic Blockchain Exploitation
** With eth-brownie for build / test / deploy pipeline support **

This is just me following along with the ConsoleCowboy's Node and Remix smart contract exploitation series.  I added eth-brownie so I could practice deployment and test automation using the Brownie framework too.  

(Javascript kind of disgusts me.  It's not as bad as PHP, but it's still quite bad.  Python is much more consistent, even if most versions are slower than JS and NodeJS -- the LibUV core was written in C though!  I simply use JS and NodeJS because I have to.  Not because I like it.)
